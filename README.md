# A-mathematical-model-of-CSR

In our lab, we are working with a B cell lymphoma cell line, known as CH12 cells with a fascinating ability. Unlike any other B cell lymphoma cell lines, CH12 cells respond to cytokine stimulation and undergoes a robust class switch recombination in vitro. This is an important  process in our immune response and  immunity against different antigens.

A B cell specific enzyme (known as AID) and a pair of long non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are known to be the most important factors for the initiation of this process and their expression levels are considered as the bottleneck of this reaction. 

For the first time, after a conditional expression of AID and quantification of lincRNAs expression, I proved the existence of an unknown factor(s) which regulates this process either.

Furthermore, creating a mathematical model of class switch recombination and predicting the expression dynamic of these unknown factors,  helped me to identify these factors among more than 25000 transcripts. Currently, I am working on the manuscript and I hope it will submit it before Christmas 2022.
